        <h1>Agile Working</h1>
        <p class="subheading"><em>“Agile intends to enable short learning cycles so that developers can pivot, when needed, to move in a direction that is more beneficial to the operational needs of system users”</em> - Will Hayes, Carnegie Mellon University </p>

        <p>This quote sums up well one of Agile’s best features, Pivoting. The software development environment, in a nutshell, is rapid, complex and ever-changing. The ability to pivot, adapt and overcome to meet the needs of a project is critical practice necessary for a team to succeed.</p>

        <p>Imagine yourself in the shoes of a newly qualified student lawyer. Your texts have been revised, examinations
            passed and your first formal position shadowing a lawyer within a local firm is this morning. Upon entering
            the world of work you find yourself entering a new environment. However, it isn’t unfamiliar. You hold in
            your backpack of knowledge the real beef behind being a lawyer. Contract law, Case resolution and everything
            you need. But now instead of case details written out in front of you on paper. You now have a living person
            sat in front of you. How do you get through to the details of the case, conduct and ensuring all details you
            need are fully given to you in a flowing conversation?</p>

        <p>This was one of the ideas proposed through to the lab. How could technology solve this problem? How could the
            introduction of software bring about a solution? The proposed technical solution came about through the form
            of a program to simulate these conversations, a branching program to replicate conversation paths. Making
            use of custom metrics to score through key factors to analyse performance. Key identification factors for
            scoring were drawn up as understanding, SRA compliance, anger, trust and fear. A few online collaboration
            brainstorming meetings later we decided to map out a prototype program using existing toolsets.</p>

        <p>Numerous online toolsets were found through our market research with two key tools showing real potential.
            Xerte and Twine. Both being advice additionally advised to us by other colleges for their usefulness and
            ease of use. Organically on paper, these two toolsets did exactly as we needed for mocking up interview
            tools. With both boasting an impressive amount of additional future potential features with ease of
            integration into existing student intranet services. Combine this with the recommendation and expertise
            available to us from professional academics these two programs brought about a sense of real potential.</p>

        <p>However, a common fundamental issue in using pre-existing toolsets is the fact that they have been build for
            a specific area of purpose in mind. Storytelling apps are directed with an audience in mind of writers,
            professional service applications are built with an audience, not at all inclined towards software
            development. Both of which is utilised for a solution would mean restricting client requirements of what
            could be possible.</p>

        <p>Within the lab, we are constantly working in a field where two different areas are looking to be combined.
            Legal and Computer science and a lot of the times deeper insight into existing tools build for these
            purposes can bring up barriers. This is why having a work methodology that is flexible to allow changes in
            direction is critical. As now we are exploring a more custom platform approach. Developed and designed by
            the lab to be more beneficial to those operating needs of the users. A set pathway often isn’t in stone for
            any project.</p>

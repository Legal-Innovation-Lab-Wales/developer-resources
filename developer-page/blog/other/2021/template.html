        <h1>Template Title</h1>
        <h2>How To Build a Feature</h2>
        <p>A brief best-practice guide for how we build features at the Legal Innovation Lab
            Wales</p>
        <p><em>Note: </em>This is a living guide. We follow these steps on a day-to-day basis. We will tweak and
            update this guide as we go along and learn form our mistakes</p>

        <h3>Start on Jira</h3>

        <p>After a feature is outlined or described by stakeholders it will be added to the <em>Backlog</em>
            column on Jira. When creating the ticket, as much detail as possible should be given. We won’t
            always be able to provide a full user story, but give as much information as you can as early as you
            can. The backlog column is roughly prioritised with the more urgent tasks appearing towards the top.
        </p>

        <h3>Teams</h3>

        <p>MS Teams is our primary communication platform. We use it in a couple of different ways. There are
            two main “Teams”; “Law - Legal Innovation Lab Wales” which is public within the Swansea.ac.uk domain
            and “LILW - Project Team” which is private to the Legal Innovation Lab Team.</p>

        <h4>Chats</h4>

        <p>The main communication in teams happens in chats. <strong>These are informal conversations about a
            range of topics</strong> with specific people or groups of people. We have a Dev Team chat and a
            Legal Tech chat which are used most frequently.</p>

        <h4>Channels</h4>

        <p>Channels are a more structured way of having conversations around a specific topic. The nature of
            channels is more persistent and asynchronous. We should use channels for <strong>discussions around
                specific topics</strong> which aren’t necessarily related to a task in Jira.</p>

        <h3>Planner</h3>

        <p>We currently use MS planner for tracking all the project ideas which come to us. Every idea which we
            discuss should get added to the “Initial Ideas” column and then progress through the chart as the
            project progresses.</p>

        <p>This is public within the Swansea.ac.uk domain so anyone can see what we are working on.</p>

        <p>The cards link to further documents in OneDrive / Sharepoint which provide further detail on the
            project.</p>

        <p>Planner doesn’t feel like the best tool for this but its the best we have at the moment - if anyone
            has any suggestions then please share!</p>

        <h3>Jira</h3>

        <p>Jira is our main software development project management tool. This is where the day-to-day of our
            dev team happens. We have several boards where individual cards correspond to individual tasks.
            These cards are often referred to interchangeably as tasks, issues or tickets.</p>

        <p>The main Dev Team board is for general tasks which don’t relate to any specific project, or relate to
            projects which are not mature enough to warrant their own board. We also have separate boards for
            other ongoing projects, currently the Scenario Platform and the Include Journey.</p>

        <p>On these project specific boards, each issue card should relate to one specific feature, bug or task.
            This normally equates to one Pull Request on GitHub.</p>

        <p>Jira is also where we have <strong>discussions related to specific tasks.</strong> Comments can guide
            the conversation while the description can be updated collaboratively with improvements from the comments.
        </p>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>

        <p>We use GitHub for version control, code repositories and peer reviews of our code.</p>

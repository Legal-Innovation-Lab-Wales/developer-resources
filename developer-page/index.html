                            <p>There are quite a few limitations to this work. As it is a web scraper it is dependent on
                                the Swansea University website for its information, if the website structure changes it
                                will stop working.</p>
                            <p>At the moment it only covers the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law, the College of
                                Science and the College of Arts and Humanities, the other colleges display their staff
                                profiles in a different structure and so will need to be added in time.</p>

                                The front end is a React web application that pulls the data out of the JSON into an

                                realise the opportunities that digital technologies offer to improve service delivery
                                and the lives of service users. As a result, there has been little digital innovation
                                within the realms of offender rehabilitation. </p>
                            <p>The development and implementation of digital technologies in the area of offender
                                rehabilitation are cutting edge. Currently, there is little to no innovation in this
                                area. As such, a range of technology can be developed to support organisations and their
                                service users.</p>

                                regulatory landscape". You can read about it and see the <a

                                    PDF tool here</a>.</p>
                            <p>This PDF is a wealth of knowledge and an incredible tool, however it only worked well on
                                Google Chrome browsers.</p>
                            <p> In a 1-day build, Ieuan took this tool and rebuilt it with React. After checking with
                                LawTech UK its now live on the web.</p>

                <p class="lead">A brief best-practice guide for how we build features at the Legal Innovation Lab
                    Wales</p>
                <p><em>Note: </em>This is a living guide. We follow these steps on a day-to-day basis. We will tweak and
                    update this guide as we go along and learn form our mistakes</p>

                <h4>Start on Jira</h4>

                <p>After a feature is outlined or described by stakeholders it will be added to the <em>Backlog</em>
                    column on Jira. When creating the ticket, as much detail as possible should be given. We won’t
                    always be able to provide a full user story, but give as much information as you can as early as you
                    can. The backlog column is roughly prioritised with the more urgent tasks appearing towards the top.
                </p>

                <p>When you come towards the end of the task you are working on, select a ticket from the top of the
                    <em>Backlog</em>, assign it to yourself and move it to <em>Next Up</em>.</p>

                <p>With the ticket in <em>Next Up</em>,there is the opportunity to refine and expand the feature
                    description. The aim is to fully describe the feature as well as we can and how it is going to look
                    when finished. You can ask for input from one or all of the rest of the team.</p>

                <p>When you are happy with the detail on the ticket, move the ticket to <em>In Progress</em>.</p>

                <h4>Move to GitHub</h4>

                <p><strong>Guides:</strong> <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">How and Why</a>, <a
                        href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/">Handbook</a></p>

                <p class="mb-0">Ensure your local branches are up to date then <em>create a new branch</em> for your
                    work. The branch
                    name should be prefixed with the type of ticket and then start with the ticket ID and the ticket
                    title.</p>

                <p class="mb-0"> Branch prefixes include: <code>feature/</code>, <code>bugfix/</code>,
                    <code>hotfix/</code>, <code>refactor/</code>
                    , <code>other/</code>.</p>

                <p> Examples: <code>feature/dt-124-how-to-build-features</code>,
                    <code>bugfix/sp-206-fix-broken-thing</code>, <code>hotfix/fix-for-this-issue</code></p>

                <p>When working on a ticket, <b>commit regularly</b>. Each commit should contain one discrete change /
                    improvement and should be made when the codebase is in a state which you want to remember. Each
                    commit which directly relates to the task should have the ticket ID at the start of it.</p>

                <p>As you are working on the feature, build it to the best of your ability, leveraging your experience,
                    creativity and ingenuity. If something comes up which you are uncertain about, or if you think of
                    something which could be a good addition to the feature, go back to the ticket on Jira and ask about
                    it there.</p>

                <p>When you’ve finished work on the ticket, push your code to GitHub and <b>create a pull request</b>
                    (PR). Your PR title should contain the ticket ID and a short title, probably similar to the ticket
                    title. The description of your PR should be an explanation of what you have done and how, including
                    screenshots if there is a front end / UI component. Then request a review from the rest of the team.
                    PRs are designed for the team to check your code makes sense, does everything its supposed to and
                    meets our standards.</p>

                <p><em>From the “How and Why” Guide:</em></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team reviewing your changes may have questions
                        or
                        comments. Perhaps the coding style doesn't match project guidelines, the change is missing unit
                        tests, or maybe everything looks great and props are in order. Pull Requests are designed to
                        encourage and capture this type of conversation.</p>

                    <p>You can also continue to push to your branch in light of discussion and feedback about your
                        commits.
                        If someone comments that you forgot to do something or if there is a bug in the code, you can
                        fix it
                        in your branch and push up the change. GitHub will show your new commits and any additional
                        feedback
                        you may receive in the unified Pull Request view.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>We strongly recommend reading the guides, if you have questions following that don't hesitate to get
                    in touch.</p>

                <h4>Back on Jira</h4>
                <p>When you code is up for PR, move the ticket to <em>Pending Review</em>. Now you should pick another
                    ticket
                    from the <em>Backlog</em> and move it to <em>Next Up</em>. You can also spend some time reviewing
                    any other
                    open PRs.
                <p>

                <h4>GitHub - Reviewing Code</h4>
                <p>When reviewing PRs we should do several things:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Go through all the code changes, leave comments
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>anywhere there is something you don’t understand</li>

                            <li>anywhere that you think something could be improved</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pull the branch and run it locally, double check everything works as intended.</li>
                    <li>Think about what has been built, if it works as intended, meets the requirements and if there
                        are any ways it could be improved. If you have any suggestions try and explain the How and Why
                        in as much detail as possible.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>You can always get involved and collaborate. If there is a small bugfix, you can make the change and
                    push the code onto the branch. If there are design or feature changes you think could work better,
                    create another branch and an additional PR back to the feature branch.</p>
                <p>There’s no rule that says the person who raises the PR has to be the sole contributor to it. If there
                    is agreement about a feature change, it might make more sense for the person who has the vision for
                    the changes to write the code, not the person who started on the branch.</p>

                    <button class="copyLink" onclick="copyText('tooling')"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></button>
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">This aims to give an overview of the tools we use and the way we use them to build
                    software in the Legal Innovation Lab Wales. It describes a current state, things are likely to
                    change over time and we’ll try to keep this up to date as things evolve.</p>

                <h4>Teams</h4>

                <p>MS Teams is our primary communication platform. We use it in a couple of different ways. There are
                    two main “Teams”; “Law - Legal Innovation Lab Wales” which is public within the Swansea.ac.uk domain
                    and “LILW - Project Team” which is private to the Legal Innovation Lab Team.</p>

                <h5>Chats</h5>

                <p>The main communication in teams happens in chats. <strong>These are informal conversations about a
                    range of topics</strong> with specific people or groups of people. We have a Dev Team chat and a
                    Legal Tech chat which are used most frequently.</p>

                <h5>Channels</h5>

                <p>Channels are a more structured way of having conversations around a specific topic. The nature of
                    channels is more persistent and asynchronous. We should use channels for <strong>discussions around
                        specific topics</strong> which aren’t necessarily related to a task in Jira.</p>

                <h4>Planner</h4>

                <p>We currently use MS planner for tracking all the project ideas which come to us. Every idea which we
                    discuss should get added to the “Initial Ideas” column and then progress through the chart as the
                    project progresses.</p>

                <p>This is public within the Swansea.ac.uk domain so anyone can see what we are working on.</p>

                <p>The cards link to further documents in OneDrive / Sharepoint which provide further detail on the
                    project.</p>

                <p>Planner doesn’t feel like the best tool for this but its the best we have at the moment - if anyone
                    has any suggestions then please share!</p>

                <h4>Jira</h4>

                <p>Jira is our main software development project management tool. This is where the day-to-day of our
                    dev team happens. We have several boards where individual cards correspond to individual tasks.
                    These cards are often referred to interchangeably as tasks, issues or tickets.</p>

                <p>The main Dev Team board is for general tasks which don’t relate to any specific project, or relate to
                    projects which are not mature enough to warrant their own board. We also have separate boards for
                    other ongoing projects, currently the Scenario Platform and the Include Journey.</p>

                <p>On these project specific boards, each issue card should relate to one specific feature, bug or task.
                    This normally equates to one Pull Request on GitHub.</p>

                <p>Jira is also where we have <strong>discussions related to specific tasks.</strong> Comments can guide
                    the conversation while the description can be updated collaboratively with improvements from the
                    comments.</p>

                <h4>GitHub</h4>

                <p>We use GitHub for version control, code repositories and peer reviews of our code.</p>

                <p>For more information on how we use GitHub, Jira, and build features see
                    <a href="#build-a-feature">“How to Build a Feature”</a></p>

            <h3> Javascript for Theme Toggle</h3>
            <p>Used to power the theme toggle on the developer blog</p>
            <p><em>Usage: </em>Use css classes .dark-mode and .light-mode to define the styles. Example is below the js.
                The script first checks to see if there is a local theme preference stored, then looks for any OS
                preference. When the toggle button is clicked it stores the preference in local storage </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">
const btn = document.querySelector("#theme-toggle");
// check to see if OS preferences for light or dark mode
const prefersDarkScheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
const prefersLightScheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)");

// check to see if local storage has a theme preference
let currentTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");

function setTheme() {
    //if no local storage check against system preferences
    if (currentTheme === null) {
        if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {
            currentTheme = "dark"
        } else if (prefersLightScheme.matches) {
            currentTheme = "light"
        } else {
            // if no preferences, default to dark theme
            currentTheme = "dark"
        }
        setTheme()
    } else if (currentTheme === "dark") {
        document.body.classList.remove("light-mode");
        document.body.classList.add("dark-mode");
    } else if (currentTheme === "light") {
        document.body.classList.remove("dark-mode");
        document.body.classList.add("light-mode");
    }
}

btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    if (currentTheme === "dark") {
        currentTheme = "light"
        setTheme()
    } else {
